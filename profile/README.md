## What is DxO PureRAW?

**DxO PureRAW** is a revolutionary, AI-powered photo software designed to transform your RAW files into exceptionally clean and detailed images before you even begin editing. It tackles the most common and frustrating problems in digital photography—noise and optical flaws—using groundbreaking artificial intelligence and DeepPRIME technology. Unlike standard noise reduction tools that can smear details, DxO PureRAW intelligently removes noise while meticulously preserving and even enhancing fine textures and edges.

With DxO PureRAW, photographers can achieve unparalleled image quality directly from their camera's sensor. The software applies automatic, profiled corrections for lens distortions, vignetting, and chromatic aberrations based on DxO's renowned optical modules, which are built from laboratory-tested data on thousands of camera and lens combinations. This means your images start with perfect geometry and clarity. The result is a "supercharged" DNG file that retains all editing flexibility for programs like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop but with significantly improved starting quality.

Its non-destructive workflow and powerful AI engine make DxO PureRAW an indispensable tool for professional photographers and enthusiasts alike. Whether you're shooting in low light at high ISO, using a fast prime lens wide open, or simply demanding the absolute best from your gear, DxO PureRAW provides a seamless solution to unlock the true potential hidden within your RAW files.
